# ARC-Tracker
This is a shiny app that maps position data on an offline map. The position data I used here is from the 2016 Atlantic Rallye for Cruisers. During the course of the regatta, every boat receives the positions of all the boats in the fleet daily in the form of textfiles. There are plenty of map plotting apps out there, however, the vast majority rely on internet access to get the map data (i.e. via the leaflet library). Internet access being limited in the middle of the Atlantic, I found a way to create an offline map to use with this app. This also allowed me to customize it, e.g. by adding the weather quadrants used in the daily weather report.
